# Conway Checkers
Conway checkers is a version of checkers invented by John Conway.

## How to Play
The game involves the following things:
* A chessboard
* A line in the middle
* Checkers (in the program, press `C` to make)

You interact with the keyboard (and the mouse):
* Click (Highlight Checker)
* Press `C` (Create Checker Below Line)
* Press `D` (Delete Highlited Checker)
* Use Arrow Keys (Move Highlited Checker)
* Press `R` (Start/Stop Saving Moves)

Checkers can only move by jumping over a neighbor (if you then don't land on something else), and at the same time making that neighbor disappear.

The goal of the game is to get as high as possible above the line.
